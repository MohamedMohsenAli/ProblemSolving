  Problem 7: Get number of vehicles made between 1950 and 2000 per make and add total vehicles column beside it, then calculate it's percentage


---my solution with correction from c GPT4

	SELECT 
    Makes.Make, 
    COUNT(*) AS NumberOfVehicles,
	(select count(*) from VehicleDetails )as TotalVehicles,
	( cast (COUNT(*)  as float) / cast ((select count(*) from VehicleDetails)as float ))  as Perc
FROM 
    VehicleDetails 
INNER JOIN 
    Makes 
ON 
    VehicleDetails.MakeID = Makes.MakeID
WHERE 
    (VehicleDetails.Year BETWEEN 1950 AND 2000)
GROUP BY
Makes.Make
ORDER BY
NumberOfVehicles DESC;



--his solution--
	SELECT * ,  cast ( NumberOfVehicles as float)/ cast (TotalVehicles as float)  as Perc  from
	( 
    select
	Makes.Make, 
    COUNT(*) AS NumberOfVehicles,
	(select count(*) from VehicleDetails )as TotalVehicles
 FROM 
    VehicleDetails 
INNER JOIN 
    Makes 
ON 
    VehicleDetails.MakeID = Makes.MakeID
WHERE 
    (VehicleDetails.Year BETWEEN 1950 AND 2000)
GROUP BY
Makes.Make
) R1
ORDER BY
NumberOfVehicles DESC;
